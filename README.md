**Energy Consumption Analysis and Peak Demand Prediction**
**Techniques and Tools Used:**
Used linear regression, SVM, and random forest models to analyze energy consumption data. Identified key peak demand drivers, such as temperature, humidity, and building features. Developed a Shiny app to provide interactive predictions, enabling users to explore energy trends and optimize consumption strategies.

**Achievements:**
Provided actionable insights for grid management, including promoting off-peak appliance use and recommending HVAC upgrades for efficiency. The Shiny app supports data-driven decisions for better energy management and demand reduction.
